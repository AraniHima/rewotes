# ReWoTes

REal WOrld TEstS

## Overview

This repository contains example test assignments used during our hiring process.

We find that regular job interview questions can often be misleading and so use more engaged "real-world" examples instead.

Each file represents an assignment similar to what one would get when hired.

## Usage

We suggest the following flow:

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) this repository on GitHub
2. Create a branch using your GitHub username as a branch name
3. Create a subfolder with your GitHub username
4. Copy one of the ReWoTe suggestions (`.md` files) to `README.md` in that subfolder and modify the content of the ReWoTe as necessary
5. Introduce any changes under the subfolder
6. Submit a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) into the `dev` branch of this repository

See [dev branch](https://github.com/Exabyte-io/rewotes/tree/dev) also.

## Notes

Examples listed here are only meant as guidelines and do not necessarily reflect on the type of work to be performed at the company. Modifications to the individual assignments with an advance notice are encouraged.

We will screen for the ability to (1) pick up new concepts quickly, (2) implement a working proof-of-concept solution, and (3) outline how the PoC can become more mature. We value attention to details and modularity.
